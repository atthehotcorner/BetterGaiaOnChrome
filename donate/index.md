        ### Why Donate?
        * BetterGaia is free and always will be, absolutely without any ads or anything else that can make me any money.
        * We are not a huge corporation, but acually a guy still in college.
        * Keeping track of Tumblr changes is time consuming and causes hair loss.
        * I work on XKit between college and work, with little time left for myself.
        * XIM and XKit servers cost a lot of money, monthly.
        * Delicious good karma instantly delivered by the cosmos.
