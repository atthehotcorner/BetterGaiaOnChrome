### Why Donate?
* BetterGaia is free and always will be, absolutely without any ads or anything else that can make money.
* We aren't a huge corporation, but acually only one guy, nearing his 20s, in college.
* Keeping track of Gaia and fixing changes takes time and stress.
* I work on BetterGaia between college and work, and you'll help make ends meet.
* A virtual hug from yours truly.
